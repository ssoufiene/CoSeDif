# CoSeDif
Conditional Diffusion Model for Generating  Synthetic Seismic Data 
This repository contains the training code and Colab notebook for CoSeDif (Conditional Seismic Diffusion), a  conditional denoising diffusion model designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic seismic data. By conditioning on fault attributes and edge maps, CoSeDif creates realistic 2D seismic images. Please see the inference notebook for generating synthetic data and calculating metrics.
