# CoSeDif
Conditional Diffusion Model for Generating  Synthetic Seismic Data 
This repository contains the training code and Colab notebook for CoSeDif (Conditional Seismic Diffusion), a  conditional denoising diffusion model designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic seismic data. By conditioning on fault attributes and edge maps, CoSeDif creates realistic 2D seismic images. Please see the inference notebook for generating synthetic data and calculating metrics. 

This project uses diffusion training code adapted from https://github.com/lucidrains/med-seg-diff-pytorch
