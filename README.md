This repository contains the training code and Colab notebook for **ConsSeisDiff** — a *conditional denoising diffusion model* designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic seismic data.  
By conditioning on **fault attributes** and **edge maps**, CoSeDif produces realistic 2D seismic images that closely resemble real datasets.

You can explore inference, synthetic data generation, and metric evaluation in the Colab notebook below:
